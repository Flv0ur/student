    "## Beginning of the year\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the year, I had no idea what was going in the class. I felt like all the topics were flying past me and I was the only one behind. I have definitely improved because I feel like now I have an idea about what is happening, and I can finally participate in everything\n",

    "\n",
    "Night at the museum went pretty well. This is because we got a lot of positive comments and our presentation was overall well delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Time\n",
    "\n",
    "On the next project, I definitely want to do more. This is because I didn't really find opportunity to help me team code. This is because I had asked to help but it didn't really seem like they needed help.\n",

    "## Next Trimester\n",
    "\n",
    "Next trimester I want to learn how to make more stuff by myself. I want to be able to make a full game with a short deadline with nice looking sprites and good code.\n"
