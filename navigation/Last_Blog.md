## <span style="color:#4bdda8ff;">Beginning of the Year</span>

<div style="background:#F5F7FF; padding:12px; border-left:5px solid #4bdda8ff; border-radius:8px;">
At the beginning of the year, I had no idea what was going in the class.  
I felt like all the topics were flying past me and I was the only one behind.  

I have definitely improved because I feel like now I have an idea about what is happening,  
and I can finally participate in everything.

<div style="background:#F5F7FF; padding:12px; border-left:5px solid #4bdda8ff; border-radius:8px;">
On the next project, I definitely want to do more.  
This is because I didn't really find opportunity to help my team code.  
This is because I had asked to help, but it didn't really seem like they needed help.
