## Beginning of the year

At the beginning of the year, I had no idea what was going in the class. I felt like all the topics were flying past me and I was the only one behind. I have definitely improved because I feel like now I have an idea about what is happening, and I can finally participate in everything

## Key Things From Sprints

From tools, some of the three things that I learned were make, virtual environments, and yaml folders

From Fundementals of Javascript, some of the top things I learned were how to transfer files, variable classes, and booleans.

From the game, quest of the spook, I learned how to manage the tree, and play test a game on both my phone and on my laptop.

## Night at the Museum

Night at the museum went pretty well. This is because we got a lot of positive comments and our presentation was overall well delivered.

## Next Time

On the next project, I definitely want to do more. This is because I didn't really find opportunity to help me team code. This is because I had asked to help but it didn't really seem like they needed help.

## Next Trimester

Next trimester I want to learn how to make more stuff by myself. I want to be able to make a full game with a short deadline with nice looking sprites and good code.
